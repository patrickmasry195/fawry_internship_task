Q1:  A breakdown of how your script handles arguments and options.
A1: 1) Options (-n, -v) are parsed using getopts.
      2) --help is handled manually because getopts doesn't support long options.
      3) After parsing options, positional arguments are extracted for search string and file.
	  4) Error messages are shown for missing inputs or invalid usage.
=====================================================================
Q2: A short paragraph: If you were to support regex or -i/-c/-l options, how would your structure change?
A2: 1) I would extend getopts to handle new flags.
      2) Move main processing logic into reusable functions.
      3) For regex, I'd replace simple string matching with [[ "$line" =~ $pattern ]] or use grep -E.
	  4) I would ensure combinations like -vic are parsed properly and features don't conflict.
=====================================================================
Q3: What part of the script was hardest to implement and why?
A3: 1) Handling combined options (-vn, -nv) was tricky before using getopts.
      2) Also ensuring correct error messages when users forget search string or file.
